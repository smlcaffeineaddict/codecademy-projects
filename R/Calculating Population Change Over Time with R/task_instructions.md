# Analyze Data with R: Calculating Population Change Over Time

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical population data for metropolitan regions using R. The goal is to calculate population growth over time and gain insights into urban expansion trends, starting with Istanbul as a case study.

This analysis is useful for urban planning teams and organizations like the UN to predict future growth and make informed resourcing decisions.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice creating and using variables in R.
- Perform calculations involving percentage and annual growth rates.
- Use basic R functions to manipulate data and generate insights.
- Explore reproducibility by swapping datasets for other cities.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Define Variables**: 
   - Store the city name and historical population data into variables.
   - Use variables to make the script adaptable for other cities.

2. **Calculate Growth Rates**:
   - Calculate the total population change over a specified period.
   - Derive the percentage growth rate and the annual percentage growth rate using mathematical operators.

3. **Create a Reporting Function**:
   - Use a pre-defined function to generate a dynamic summary of the results.
   - Pass appropriate arguments (year range, population data, city name) to the function to produce a formatted report.

4. **Reproduce Analysis for Other Periods**:
   - Modify variables to analyze different time periods and observe growth trends.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
3. Follow the inline comments to execute the script step-by-step.
4. Modify variables and arguments as desired to analyze data from other cities or time periods.

## Note
This exercise simplifies the analysis by using an arithmetic mean for population growth, rather than the geometric mean, to practice fundamental R operators.

## Output
The script generates:
- A dynamic summary of population growth trends for the specified period.
- Insights into annual growth rates for different periods, easily adaptable to other cities or datasets.
